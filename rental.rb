# Create the many-to-many (also has-many-through) relationship between Person and Book
# using the intermediate class Rental. The following should be implemented:
# Create the has-many side of Book and Rental (a book has many rentals).
# Create the belongs-to side of Rental and Book (a rental belongs to a book).
# Create the has-many side of Person and Rental (a person has many rentals).
# Create the belongs-to side of Rental and Person (a rental belongs to a person).
# Modify the constructor of Rental so Book and Person are set in it.
